        <p>I am currently an advisor on the exploratory AI team in the discovery chemistry research organization of <a href='https://www.lilly.com/' target='_blank'>Eli Lilly and Company</a>. My current research focuses on developing multi-agent systems to accelerate drug discovery. I began my career at Lilly as a postdoc in the global computational chemistry and cheminformatics team. My postdoctoral work focused primarily on developing transfer learning methods for template-free chemical reaction product prediction for novel and low-data chemical spaces using large-scale geometric machine learning. During my time as a postdoc I was co-chair of the Lilly Postdoc Community, a group that develops communtiy, boosts visibility, and organizes professional development events for Lilly postdocs.</p>

        <p>I received my doctor of philosophy and master of science in organic chemistry in 2023 from the department of <a href='https://chem.cornell.edu' target='_blank'>chemistry and chemical biology</a> at <a href='https://cornell.edu' target='_blank'>Cornell University</a> in Ithaca, New York where I worked under the mentorship of <a href='https://chemistry.cornell.edu/david-b-collum' target='_blank'>Professor David B. Collum</a> on the structural and mechanistic study of organoalkali chemistry, a cornerstone of asymmetric synthesis for the better part of the past century. In the spring of 2023, I interned at <a href='https://www.exscientia.ai/' target='_blank'>Exscientia</a> (now a part of <a href='https://www.recursion.com/'>Recursion</a>) exploring methods of improving early-stage compound scoring, ranking, and selection using machine learning.</p>
        
        <p>Prior to Cornell, I graduated from <a href='https://nyu.edu' target='_blank'>New York University's</a> <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/' target='_blank'>global campus in Abu Dhabi</a> in the United Arab Emirates with a bachelors of science in chemistry (with further specialization in biochemistry) and a minor in urban development and economics. During my time there I worked under the mentorship of Professors <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/pance-naumov.html' target='_blank'>Panƒçe Naumov</a> and <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/wael-m-rabeh.html' target='_blank'>Wael Rabeh</a> to explore the structure and function relationships of bioluminescence. Previously, I received an International Baccalaureate diploma from the <a href='https://www.uwc-usa.org/' target='_blank'>Armand Hammer United World College of the American West</a> in Montezuma, New Mexico supported by the Davis Scholarship. I was born in Overland Park, Kansas and grew up in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>

        <p>Away from the bench, I am an avid cyclist and snowboarder, an ameteur art enthusiast, and an ardent foodie.

                <p>My graduate research focused on the mechanistic determination of alkylations of Oppolzer's camphorsultam-derived enolates. On the side, I provided compuational chemistry support to a wide range of projects throughout the department and dabbled in developing generative molecular graph models with a project team. At NYU Abu Dhabi my research focused on physical studies of bio- and chemi-luminescence, with experience in the spectroscopy, structural biochemistry, and computational aspects of the systems. <a href='/research.html#past'>Read more</a>
